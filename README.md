# AcrophobiaVR
Made with Unity3D ver. 2020.3.16f1

# Introduction

A prototype of VR environment to the use of clinical psychologists to assist patients with acrophobia.
This environment is a training for my skills in development and virtual environment creation with Unity3D, therefore
some elements in this prototype are not design for healthcare, but for exercise instead.

Exclusively compatible with Oculus Quest 2.

# How to use it

In the environment, use the elevator to choose a height to reach.
At the balcony, choose the fence type you want, you can also deploy a plank to overlook the city.

# Inputs

"A" to open/close the menu
"Right trigger" to interact with the environment
"Left thumbstick" to teleport

# Future progress

Restrain user's movements to avoid some "out of bounds".
Add some gamification to the project (like an object to pick up).
Improve environment immersion (agents's AI, sound design).
Add compatibility with other VR headsets.
